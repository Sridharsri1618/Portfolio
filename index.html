    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Sridhar, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Panimalar Engineering College. From the early days of learning HTML and CSS, I discovered a passion for creating engaging, user-friendly websites and applications. Over time, this passion has grown into a commitment to becoming a skilled full-stack developer who can build seamless digital experiences from front-end interfaces to back-end logic.</p>

    <p>I have gained practical experience through a 1-month internship at InternPe as a Web Development Intern. This role helped me apply my foundational knowledge to real-world projects, enhance my coding practices, and collaborate effectively with a professional team. Currently, I am furthering my skills through a full-stack development training program at Mindenious, focusing on both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

    <p>My technical strengths include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on building responsive, clean, and interactive user interfaces. I plan to expand my expertise into Python programming to enhance my back-end and automation skills.</p>

    <p>I regularly solve coding problems on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank to sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for challenging technical interviews.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm enthusiastic about collaborating in teams, sharing knowledge, and contributing to projects that push my limits and expand my capabilities. I look forward to a career where I can combine creativity, technical skills, and problem-solving to deliver innovative solutions.</p>
